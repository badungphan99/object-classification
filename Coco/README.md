# Get data from [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home) datasets


I will show you the way how to create your own COCO-style datasets.

## Install

1. Install dependences: Python3, Cython, numpy, pycocotools, matplotlib, opencv-python

    `sudo apt install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip`
    
    `pip 3 install cython numpy pycocotools matplotlib opencv-python`
2. Download [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#download) datasets on your computer (Images and Annotations)
3. Pull the repository `git clone https://github.com/badungphan99/object-classification`
4. Change some **paths** in my code to yours on computer in [main.py](https://github.com/badungphan99/object-classification/blob/master/Coco/main.py)
5. Run and wait, it may take a long time.
